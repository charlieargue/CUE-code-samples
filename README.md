# CUE Post-Mortem



>  "I would certainly appreciate and will solicit your input on who we should be keeping around... I think that you are seeing the opportunity of being this very senior person [and] the advocate for tech debt on the team ... great talk, I feel like I learned a ton, so thank you for that -- I feel like I've been educated quite a bit, and this is exactly the kind of thing I want to get out of these kinds of conversations." [during a 1-on-1] 

— 🗣 [Bobby Wayne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbywayne/), VP, Software Development at Cue Health `Aug 17, 2022` 



>  "Karl, a dev like you would be wanted anywhere. Thank you for all the help and mentorship. I learned a lot from you and already seen how much I've grown as an engineer, that's all thanks to you."

# Code Samples



### Preparing for RTK-Q

* [**Re-usable Hooks:** DRY-ing and Hiding the Implementation Details](Hooks.md)



### RTK-Q Refactoring Journey

- [**Account Profile:** Removing Redux boilerplate and redundant state management](Account-Profile.md) 
- 
- 
- 
- RTK-Q: show my typescript ==builder pattern==, yes!
- RTK-Q: big ==live visit one== (just after, yes I think! it'll be sanitized!)
- Account Profile.tsx (see below)
- show "what we were able ==to remove==", and maybe show as an example, one of the bad FILES we were entirely able to remove, like LV or something :), show some ==screen grabs of the GITHUB removal RED tags!!!!==💎
- show the ==useEffects== we removed!
- Show 👎 BEFORE & 👍 AFTER: `setUnreadMessages` b/c now using ==React.Context== here below



# State Mngmnt / RTK-Q and React.Context REFACTORING BEFORE & AFTER:

- [ ] **React.Context:** 👎 BEFORE & 👍 AFTER: 

  - [ ] ```js 
    EVERY LITTLE THING!
    👎 BEFORE & (for real! it almost looks like a joke ;)
    // setUnreadMessages: (state) => {
            //     if (state.twilioModal) {
            //         return {
            //             ...state,
            //             twilioModal: {
            //                 ...state.twilioModal,
            //                 unreadMessages: true,
            //             },
            //         };
            //     }
            // },
      
      
      
      👍 AFTER: 
    
    case 'setUnreadMessages': {
      return { ...state, unreadMessages: true };
    }
    ```











- [ ] POKAZ: the <DataFilters> and `<DataFiltersNew>`
- [ ] POKAZ: the Live Visit container lol and after with RTK-Q :) ==and simpler visit history?==
- [ ] SEE: [Code-RTK-Q-allowed-us-to-DECOMISH.md](/Users/karlgolka/PROJECTS/FYI/_Employers/Cue Health/__POCs/POC-2-RESULTS-✅/Code-RTK-Q-allowed-us-to-DECOMISH.md)

- [ ] break up into files
- [ ] ==STYLE-GUIDE!!!==
- [ ] YES: show the one with 7 useEffects LV, right?
- [ ] YES:  before and after?

https://www.loom.com/share/cd0eafe654e54a539859d034da8a0e50 (24 minutes in is ==Before.tsx==)

- [ ] VIP! must show this! it's sanitized I think, check it again! Super nice :) https://www.loom.com/share/cfa602e0bbc74e949d9a00efe4d2971e RTKQ Kick-off of my 749 epic ... == and shows my style-guide==
