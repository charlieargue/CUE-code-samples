# CUE Post-Mortem



>  "I would certainly appreciate and will solicit your input on who we should be keeping around... I think that you are seeing the opportunity of being this very senior person [and] the advocate for tech debt on the team ... great talk, I feel like I learned a ton, so thank you for that -- I feel like I've been educated quite a bit, and this is exactly the kind of thing I want to get out of these kinds of conversations." [during a 1-on-1]
